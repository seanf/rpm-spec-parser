The rpm-spec-parser is a java API and Ant task that allows you to parse an RPM spec file
and extract items that are defined inside it. 

It's useful for building java code that is to be shipped inside an RPM. The RPM can be used 
as the single place where the version of the software is defined and the ant scripts can 
query the spec file when building to get the version number and other interesting fields.
